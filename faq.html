                    vimigo is a performance reward system that helps you regulate performance rewarding in your company. This is to motivate your people so everyone strives to contribute his/her best to the company. As a boss, you no longer need to worry about making decisions on who you should reward or who you should terminate, for the system already has the data and the data are transparent to everyone -- no argument, no dispute, no hassle. You let their results speak for themselves.

                    In the long run, you as the boss will have more time to work on something which is more meaningful. Together everyone is driven towards your company's vision. This benefit alone, we believe, will overweigh the price of the system per se, because even hiring a full-time admin for 2k/month isn't necessarily able to help you manage performance rewarding in a company.
